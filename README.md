# screening-test

The first problem did not have many problems except I had to use malloc in order for me to test the results. The second problem (repeated_char.c), I ran into problems, with printing the amount of characters when it came to single characters in an array. I may have had better success if I chose another language to write it. I had created comments as I was going through the problems to include what I was thinking.

Overall, I do not think this is the most efficient method but I did try to finish within 45 minutes.
